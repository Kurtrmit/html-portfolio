        <p>When man-eating Titans first appeared 100 years ago, humans found safety behind massive walls that stopped
            the
            giants in
            their tracks. But the safety they have had for so long is threatened when a colossal Titan smashes through
            the
            barriers,
            causing a flood of the giants into what had been the humans' safe zone. During the carnage that follows,
            soldier
            Eren
            Jaeger sees one of the creatures devour his mother, which leads him to vow that he will kill every Titan. He
            enlists
            some friends who survived to help him, and that group is humanity's last hope for avoiding extinction at the
            hands of
            the monsters.</p>
